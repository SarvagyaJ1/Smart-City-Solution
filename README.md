# Smart-City-Solution
This project is a web-page based project to create an interactive smart city solution website

Welcome to the code for the Smart City Solution Webpage which has many interactive elements such as a google map, buttons and bargraphs made with an scientific theme to appeal the user. 

**TO RUN THE CODE OPEN INDEX.HTML**

Note: The app.py and the commented section of the java file showcases the attempt to include flask to the project which would allow for the community collaboration but it does not work as an error kept showcasing even after countless errors. Moreover, The commented section of the water.html file showcases an attempt to include the water animation to make the webpage look better however, even after a couple of google searches it didn't work.

Apart from that enjoy the webpage with unique features and diagrams!
